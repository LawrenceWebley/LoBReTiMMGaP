LoBReTiMMGap
============

A Location-Based Real-Time Mobile Multiplayer Gaming Platform for Android

LoBReTiMMGap consists of three (hopefully) tightly integrated components:

1. The Spatial(Object) Provider

2. The Networking Component

3. The Client-side Android Framework

The whole project is written in Java and aims to be modular enough to be reusable by other game developers.
